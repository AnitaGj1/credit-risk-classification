# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## _Overview of the Analysis:_

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model used for credit risk analysis. The model aims to predict whether a loan is a high-risk loan or a healthy loan based on a variuos features. By analysing the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the model, we can assess its effectiveness in identifying credit risk and make recommendations for its use.

## _Results:_

The machine learning model used in this analysis achieved the following performance metrics:
* **Accuracy Score:** 0.99
  
* **Precision Score:**
    * Healthy Loan: 1.00
    * High-Risk Loan: 0.87
 
* **Recall Score:**
    * Healthy Loan: 1.00
    * High-Risk Loan: 0.89
 
* **F1-Score:**
    * Healthy Loan: 1.00
    * High-Risk Loan: 0.88
 
## _Summary_

The machine learning model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting loan credit risk. It achieved an accuracy score of 0.99, indicating that it correctly classified 99% of the loan cases. The precision scores for both healthy and high-risk loans are relatively high, with a precision of 1.00 for healthy loans and 0.87 for high-risk loans. This implies that when the model predicts a loan as healthy, it is correct 100% of the time, and when it predicts a loan as high-risk, it is correct 87% of the time.

The recall scores further support the model's effectiveness, with a recall of 1.00 for healthy loans and 0.89 for high-risk loans. This means that the model can identify 100% of the healthy loans correctly, and 89% of the high-risk loans. The F1-scores, which consider both precision and recall, are also high, indicating a good balance between precision and recall for both classes.

Considering the overall performance of the machine learning model, it demonstrates a high level of accuracy, precision, and recall in predicting credit risk. The model evaluated in this analysis proves to be a valuable asset for credit risk analysis and decision-making.  However, it's important to note that no model is perfect, and there may be instances where the model misclassifies loans. Therefore, it is recommended to use this model as a decision-support tool rather than relying solely on its predictions.
